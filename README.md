MotionVDL 2023 (active development)
-----------------------------------

Application development for CI536 Integrated group project.



Description
----------------

Motion Video Data Labeller is a tool for producing labelled
datasets from video data for use in supervised machine learning.



Potentional applications of the labelled data
-------------------------------------------------

The functionality of MotionVDL could be extended with 
a helper vision system that could help identify poorly 
labelled frame data.

Label sequences could be used to train LSTM models and 
labelled frames could be used to train conditional GANs.

LSTM-GANs could be used to model the label sequences and 
produce generated sequences that could then be used to 
produce new video data from a conditional GAN trained on 
the labelled frame data.
